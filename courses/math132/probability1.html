    <p>We begin our introduction to probability with the simplest case: when an experiment is performed with equally likely outcomes.  Here
    "experiment" need not refer to the hard science you had in mind, but something as simple as rolling a 6-sided die.  There are 6 equally likely
    outcomes: the numbers from one to six.  We call the set of all possible outcomes the <b>sample space</b>, denoted by S:
    \[S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\]
      An <b>outcome</b> is a single element of the sample space, and an <b>event</b> is a subset of the sample space. Each of the six outcomes in this 
      example are equally likely (assuming the die is not weighted), and it is not possible for any two of the outcomes to occur.  This property: 
      that the outcomes do not overlap, is that they are <b>mutually exclusive</b>.  We will see that when events
      are mutually exclusive, the probability that any one of them happens is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.
    </p>
    
    <p>When there are \(n\) many equally likely outcomes, then the probability of any one of them occurring is
    \[\frac{1}{n}\]
      Since individual outcomes, by their nature, are mutually exclusive, the odds of one of \(x\) many of them happening is
      \[\frac{x}{n}\]
      For instance, if a group of animals consists of 15 dogs, 20 cats, and 3 kangaroos, and an animal is selected at random, let \(X\) be the 
      selected animal.  The probability of selecting a kangaroo is
      \[P(X = \text{kangaroo}) = \frac{3}{38}\]
      since there are 38 equally likely outcomes (the 38 total animals), 3 of which are in the event we are interested in (the 3 kangaroos).  To find 
      the probability that either a cat <b>or</b> a dog is selected, since an animal can't be both a cat and a dog simultaneously, these events are
      mutually exclusive, and
      \[P(X = \text{cat} \cup X = \text{dog}) = P(X = \text{cat}) + P(X = \text{dog}) = \frac{20}{38} + \frac{15}{38} = \frac{35}{38}\]
      The opposite of an event is called its <b>complement</b>.  In the above example, the event of <b>not</b> selecting a kangaroo is the 
      complement of selecting a kangaroo.  The probability of the complement of an event \(E\), denoted \(\overline{E}\) is
      \[P(\overline{E}) = 1 - P(E)\]
      Note that the event of not selecting a kangaroo is the same as the event of selecting a cat or dog.  So,
      \[P(X = \text{cat} \cup X = \text{dog}) = P(\overline{X = \text{kangaroo}}) = 1 - P(X = \text{kangaroo}) = 1 - \frac{3}{38} = \frac{35}{38}\]
      which is exactly the result we obtained using another method.  This happens generally in the study of probability: there are often many ways
      of solving the same problem!
    </p>

      
    <p>Say we want to find the probability of rolling either a 6 or less than a 3, where \(X\) is the outcome of the roll of a 6-sided die.  The two 
      events, "rolling a 6" and "rolling less than 3" are mutually exclusive: they don't overlap.  So,
    \[P(X < 3 \cup X = 6) = P(X < 3) + P(X = 6)\]
    Then, the events of rolling less than a 3 is the same as rolling a 2 or lower, which is the same as rolling a 1 or 2.  So,
    \[P(X < 3) + P(X = 6) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 6) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\]
    </p>


    <p>Things get complicated when we want to find the probability that one of two events will occur when they are not mutually exclusive (they overlap).
      For instance, what is the probability of rolling higher than a 3, or rolling an even number?  The outcomes in this event are
      \[\{2, 4, 5, 6\}\]
      so the probability is
      \[P(X > 3 \cup X = \text{even}) = \frac{4}{6}\]
      However, note that the outcomes in the individual events "rolling higher than a 3" and "rolling an even number" are
      \[\{4, 5, 6\} \text{ and } \{2, 4, 6\}\]
      respectively.  If we were to add the probabilities of those events, we'd get
      \[P(X > 3) + P(X = \text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1\]
      which is certainly not true.  The issue here is that we have double-counted the overlap between the two events.  This leads us to the
      inclusion-exclusion princple,
      \[P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E \cap F)\]
      That is, the overlap between the two events is
      \[P(X > 3 \cap X = \text{even}) = \frac{2}{6}\]
      since there are 2 numbers which are both greater than 3 and even, namely 4 and 6.  Using this information together with the inclusion-exclusion 
      princple, we can now solve the problem:
      \[P(X > 3 \cup X = \text{even}) = P(X > 3) + P(X = \text{even}) - P(X > 3 \cap X = \text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = 
      \frac{4}{6}\]
      which is the same result we obtained previously!
