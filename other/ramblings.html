  <p>The following are my ramblings on two subjects: <i>why</i> one should study math, and <i>how</i> to succeed at its study (in my opinion).</p>

  <h2>Why study math?</h2>
    
  <p>We have calculators and computers that can “do math”, right?  As technology advances, humans' necessary roles change.  
    There are skills that <i>most</i> of us don't currently need, which we might have been helpless without a few hundred years ago.  
    I don't know how to operate any farming equipment, and yet I consume food grown on farms.  So clearly, we've <i>delegated</i> certain tasks 
    which are either too tedious or specialized to technology/other people, to free up our own mental/physical resources for other tasks.</p>

  <p>Now first of all, I would say that there is a difference between <i>computation</i> and <i>doing math</i>.  A computer can perform arithmetic and do 
    calculus better than any human can.  But learning to compute isn't all we do – we learn to observe the world around us and extract a solvable 
    problem from it: the world isn't going to just throw equations at you, which you can summarily throw into a computer.  Until recently, this 
    was entirely beyond the realm of anything a computer could attempt.  With the rise of large language models, this stage of the problem-solving 
    process is now at least somewhat within reach of a computer.  However, there are two important points to be made against reliance on such.</p>

  <p>AI still isn't very good at this: it doesn't really “think”, but rather generates something which <i>looks</i> correct (this often does happen to 
    coincide with what is actually correct).  However, it will get things wrong.  What role does a human play if AI is used to solve a problem?  
    Being able to recognize the difference between a correct and incorrect solution is important.  The argument has been made that AI is a time-saving 
    tool: a person writing an essay can assume the role of “copy editor” while the AI acts as a room full of subordinate “copy writers”.  But in the 
    real world, before you can be an editor, you need to have first been a writer – so that you're capable of recognizing the difference between good 
    and bad writing in the first place.  Likewise, you need to know how to solve things yourself to be able to recognize major logical errors in an 
    AI's process: what added benefit do you bring to an employer if you're just plugging something into an AI?  They could just do that themselves: 
    you'll need the expertise to evaluate the output, and there is no shortcut to that expertise.</p>

  <p>Mind you, AI is getting better.  We don't generally double-check the output of our calculators, because it's reliable.  What if AI reaches that 
    level of reliability – we might as well abandon the study of math altogether, as we have abandoned the study of blacksmithing, right?  No – there 
    are benefits to the study of math beyond the capability of <i>doing</i> the math itself.  In fact, when it comes to something advanced (like 
    calculus), the odds that you will manually compute derivatives in your future work/life are exceedingly low.  But there are secondary benefits to its 
    study – namely, you will develop strong problem-solving and logical reasoning skills: which are certainly applicable in all walks of life.  It is 
    dangerous to outsource critical thinking, a skill we need to keep sharp.  One of the most valuable courses I took in my undergrad was first-year 
    chemistry: not because I do any chemistry in my daily life (I don't), but because writing lab reports taught me to communicate more effectively 
    and concisely.</p>

  <p>Ok, so maybe I've convinced you that the higher-level tasks of problem solving shouldn't be delegated to an AI, lest we want our brains to 
    atrophy from disuse.  But what about the low-level tasks, the <i>computation</i>?  I've seemingly disparaged that as “beneath us”: should we not leave 
    this coal-shovelling, muck-mopping duty to the subservient machines?  Again, no.  It can seem silly to learn how to perform rote computations 
    which we will inevitably eventually delegate.  And yet, there is good reason we don't let small children use calculators: learning arithmetic is 
    an important stepping stone towards learning the more advanced concepts.  A person most likely learns to do some gardening by hand before hopping 
    on a tractor.  I don't often crawl, and yet learning to crawl was an important step in my walking education.</p>


  <h2>How to succeed at the study of math?</h2>

  <p>Throughout your study of math to date, you've likely found that practice was key.  Many tests don't go beyond testing the rote computational 
    knowledge, and so memorizing how to perform those computations – without necessarily understanding the why or how of it – was likely sufficient.  
    That is, practising a computational procedure with various numbers, so that you can perform the same computation with different numbers on a test.  
    Some of what you'll see in your courses will still be computation, and so you may find your previous strategies effective for these components 
    of these courses.</p>

  <p>However, you'll often be looking at things a bit more deeply than this: extracting computational problems from situations where it is not 
    immediately apparent how the math applies (the dreaded word problems).  How do we improve our ability to do so, when it's not obvious?  A common 
    refrain is “I don't know where to start”.  This is fair – often, doing mathematics (beyond rote computation) is a business of getting stuck, 
    and learning how to get oneself unstuck.  There is the key – learning to do this oneself.  It is easy to get frustrated after staring at a problem 
    for 5 minutes, and to decide to seek help/some resource.  I'm not suggesting that you never do this – but rather resist the urge to do so 
    immediately, and don't flee from a problem at the first sign of adversity.  AI is one of the least helpful “learning” tools, since it'll do all 
    of the thinking for you.  A common resource people like is Youtube videos.  This is marginally better.  However, you'll come to find that just
    because something feels like learning, doesn't mean that it is.  Watching a Youtube video will often help you learn to do a particular 
    computational procedure, by watching that procedure performed.  However, even the slightest variation in that procedure is likely to cause you to 
    have no idea what to do.  Deep learning isn't about being able to perform a task when it looks exactly like the one in the textbook - it's about
    being able to adapt your knowledge and problem-solve in a less familiar situation.  Much like watching people lift weights 
    at the gym will help to a point (you may learn correct form), you're not going to get great at doing bench until you actually start doing bench.  
    Likewise, watching Youtube will make you a lot better at watching someone do math.</p>

  <p>This is all to say that there really is no substitute for attempting problems yourself, in order to get better at solving problems (which sounds 
    like nagging, or obvious, but it is the truth!)</p>
    
  <p>One easy trick to lose belly fat doctors don't want you to know about</p>
  <p>How this stay-at-home mom earned $2179 a week by working online</p>
  <p>Get shredded working out only 10 minutes a day</p>
    
  <p>You likely wouldn't trust these shortcuts.  Why look for shortcuts in the study of math?</p>

  <p>Finally - it is true that tests are often “game-able” to a certain extent (including in math).  If you are hyper-focused on the earning of “points” 
    (marks, grades...), you may often find yourself asking questions like “What is the format of the test?” and “What is it out of?”  Anecdotally, I can 
    say that a focus on grades tends to be inversely correlated with achievement of grades.  This might sound like me griping, but it's actually advice: 
    the highest-performing students in my previous classes have rarely had any questions about grades or technicalities.  To achieve the best grades, 
    it is best to put the points out of your mind, and focus on learning for its own sake.  It also will probably relieve a lot of pressure and make your 
    studies more fun (it did for me)!</p>
