    <p><u>Ingredients:</u></p>

    <p>1 package (3.5 cups) graham crumbs<br>
    2 cups shredded (or flaked) sweetened coconut (a 200g package)<br>
    2 eggs<br>
    1 cup unsalted butter<br>
    ½ cup sugar<br>
    ½ cup + 2 tbsp cocoa</p>

    <p>1 cup butter<br>
    ⅓ cup heavy cream (35%, whipping cream)<br>
    ¼ cup Bird’s custard powder<br>
    4 cups icing sugar</p>

    <p>8 oz semi-sweet chocolate (1 package)<br>
    7 tsp butter</p>

    <p>Crack 2 eggs into a small mixing bowl, set aside.<br>
    In a small pot over low heat (setting 2 or 3), melt 1 cup butter.  Mix in ½ cup sugar, and ½ cup + 2 tbsp cocoa powder, stir occasionally until melted and smooth.<br>
    Remove from heat, and immediately beat half of this mixture into the eggs in mixing bowl.  The goal is to not heat the eggs up too quickly, to prevent them from curdling, so add the cocoa mixture carefully.  Then beat the egg + ½ cocoa mixture back into the pot which has the remaining ½ of the cocoa mixture.<br>
    Return to low heat and stir constantly until of a custard consistency (about 2-3 minutes).<br>
    Remove pot from heat, and mix in the graham crumbs and coconut, stir until the same throughout.<br>
    Press into a 13X9 pan and put in fridge to set while you make the icing layer.</p>

    <p>In medium mixing bowl, cream together 1 cup softened butter and ¼ cup custard powder.  Then begin mixing in 4 cups icing sugar, 1 cup at a time.  You'll probably manage 3 cups before it gets too tough to mix, and you need to add some of the ⅓ cup heavy cream before mixing the rest in.  Putting off adding the liquid ingredient improves the icing's final consistency.  Add food colouring to icing if desired for a particular occasion.<br>
    Spread over chilled bottom layer, and chill to set (about an hour)</p>

    <p>In small pot (if you don’t have a double boiler) over low heat, melt 7 tsp butter, then add 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate and melt.  If you are careful and stir constantly, it should be possible to melt chocolate in an ordinary pot with the stove’s heat set as high as 3, without burning it.  When the chocolate seems almost completely melted, reduce heat to minimum, and remove it immediately after the mixture seems just about smooth throughout.<br>
    Spread over chilled bars.  There will be just barely enough chocolate to cover the entire pan, so work quickly with it before it hardens (but gently, as the hot chocolate will partially melt the layer below it, so try to “skim” across the top of the bars to avoid mixing the two layers together).  Let the chocolate set before cutting (about 2 hours in fridge), then cut and serve (although you will find it easier to cut the bars after letting them thaw a bit, then return them to the fridge).</p>
