    <p><u><b>Ingredients:</b></u></p>

    <p>4 cups cake flour<br>
    3 cups all-purpose flour<br>
    5 tsp baking powder<br>
    1/2 tbsp salt</p>

    <p>1.75 cups butter<br>
    4 cups sugar<br>
    3/8 cup vegetable oil<br>
    1/8 cup vanilla<br>
    3 cups whole milk (3.25%)<br>
    16 egg whites<br>
    1 cup sugar</p>

    <p>1 cup shortening<br>
    1 cup butter<br>
    1/8 cup vanilla<br>
    1 kg icing sugar<br>
    Milk as necessary</p>

    <p>1/4 cup gelatin<br>
    2 cups glucose<br>
    1/4 cup glycerin<br>
    1/2 cup shortening<br>
    4kg icing sugar</p>

    <p><u><b>Instructions:</b></u></p>

    <p>This is an original recipe, developed over years of making cakes - it is the standard cake I will make when I'm feeling less lazy, and want higher quality.  The following are directions to make a particularly large, "wedding-sized" tiered cake.  The image above is a practice cake I made to experiment with the recipe and working with fondant.</p>

    <p>Before beginning, bring egg whites, butter, and whole milk to room temperature.</p>
      
    <p>Dry ingredients: Sift together 4 cups cake flour, 3 cups all-purpose flour, 5 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tbsp salt</p>
      
    <p>Cream together 1.75 cups butter with 4 cups sugar until fluffy.  Mix in 3/8 cup vegetable oil, and 1/8 cup vanilla.</p>
      
    <p>Alternately mix in the dry ingredients and 3 cups whole milk (3.25%), until thoroughly combined.</p>
      
    <p>Beat 16 egg whites to stiff peaks with 1 cup sugar.  Mix in about 1/3 of the meringue, then fold in the rest until well enough combined.</p>
      
    <p>Line a 16” round pan with parchment paper, grease and flour both it and the sides of the pan.  Place 4 flower nails in center of pan.  Soak and wring out bake-even strips (or towel strips, fastened with safety pins), and wrap around the sides of the pan.  Fill pan with the batter, shake gentle to distribute it (aim for about 2/3 of the pan full.  Bake at 350F about 35 minutes.</p>
      
    <p>Once cake is rising level but approaching top edge of pan (getting dangerously close to the damp strips), reduce heat to 325F and remove the strips.  Bake another 35-40 minutes.  Use the toothpick test in multiple spots.  When done, remove to cool.</p>
      
    <p>Flip out onto cooling rack once cool, remove flower nails and parchment paper.  Flip onto flat cookie sheet and slide layer onto iced cake (or if first layer, flip onto serving dish).</p>
      
    <p>***** This amount of the recipe is good for one 16” round cake 2” thick, or for a 12”, 8”, and 4” cake 2” thick.</p>
      
    <p>Icing: Cream 1 cup shortening with 1 cup butter, mix in 1/8 cup vanilla, 1 kg icing sugar, and milk as necessary, by the tablespoon, until spreadable.  Likely will need 4 times this icing recipe for a full wedding cake, or more.</p>
      
    <p>Fondant: Add 1/4 cup gelatin to 1 cup cool water, and allow to bloom for about 15 minutes in a small mixing bowl.</p>
      
    <p>Combine with pot to make a double boiler, and at 3 on stove, melt until clear and incorporated, using a rubber scraper.  Set aside.</p>
      
    <p>In medium mixing bowl double boiler, melt 2 cups glucose.  Pour in gelatin mixture, keep stirring with rubber scraper.  Add 1/4 cup glycerin.  Add 1/2 cup shortening, stir until melted and incorporated.</p>
      
    <p>Let cool about 10 minutes.  Then, in a large mixing bowl, make a well in 2kg icing sugar and add mixture, stir in.  Then knead with approximately an additional 2kg icing sugar on a flat surface.</p>
      
    <p>***** ASSEMBLY OF CAKE: Place layers of the same size together, with just buttercream icing between and around the top and sides.  Roll out fondant on a large plastic sheet (like a painter's drop sheet), and then flip onto cake, remove plastic, smooth out fondant and trim edges.  Trim down dowels and insert in cake, place cake board, and repeat until cake is complete, then decorate.</p>
